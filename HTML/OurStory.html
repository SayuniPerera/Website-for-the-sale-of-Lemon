                <p> After years of cultivating lemons on a small scale, primarily for personal use, the founder of this agricultural venture, Mr. Sarath Perera, was inspired to transform his paddy fields into a thriving lemon orchard. Drawing upon the extensive experience of the seasonal weather changes within the year and a deep understanding of local fauna and flora, the foundation for this agribusiness was laid back in 2008. <br>
                    As the paddy field underwent its transformation into a lush orchard, small lemon tree saplings were simultaneously nurtured in polyethene bags under carefully controlled humid conditions to encourage robust root development. Once the lemon saplings had matured into fully rooted plants within the polyethylene bags, they were further nourished with essential growth elements mixed into water, ensuring their continued healthy development. <br>
                    When the opportune moment arrived to transplant them into the soil of the meticulously crafted orchard, each lemon sapling was carefully planted row by row, ensuring optimal spacing and arrangement. <br> With the assistance of family members, the founder of Lemonozo tenderly nurtured the young lemon plants with unwavering care and affection. Gradually, the plants thrived, blossoming into beautiful lemon flowers signaling that the first harvest was soon to come. </br> As time passed, the first cluster of ripe, juicy lemons was harvested, and as a mark of reverence, they were initially offered to Lord Buddha. <br>
                    From that point onwards, little by little, the Lemonozo agribusiness flourished into what we are today!
